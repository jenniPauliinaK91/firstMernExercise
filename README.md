# firstMernExercise
The aim of this project was to learn the basics of MERN stack. I had no experience with MongoDB, Express or Node, and only a little knowlwdge of React before. 
I wanted to make a mock (running) race browsing and registration website with user authentication. 
On this website user can browse races (doens't require logging in), register as a user, log in, and as a logged in user, register for races and create a new race.
Time was a luxury I did not have for this project, as I had a little over a week to put this together. For that reason, I wasn't able to add all features I wanted
and had to cut corners in some areas. For example, I intented to have two distict categories of users: basic user who signs up for races, aka a Runner, and an organisation
who creates and manages races. Alas, I run out of time and had to settle with only one universal user type. 

The project structure isn't the cleanest either. I changed the way I structured my code as I went along and learned more about React, for example how to implement custom hooks. 
For instance, there is a useLogin custom hook for logging in, but not for registering as a user because I had not quite learned how to do that at the 
time of writing that functionality. 

Overall, this was a fun practice project to make.
